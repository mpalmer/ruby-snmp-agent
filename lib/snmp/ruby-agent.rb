##
# = SNMP Agent skeleton
#
# Objects of this class are capable of acting as SNMP agents -- that is,
# receiving SNMP PDUs and (possibly) returning data as a result of those
# requests.
#
# We call this class a skeleton, though, since as it stands this agent won't
# do much of anything -- it only has support for the most basic of system
# information (sysDescr, sysUptime, sysContact, sysName, and sysLocation).
# In order to get more interesting data out of it, you'll need to define
# code to examine the host machine and it's environment and return data.
#
# What values get returned is determined by "plugins", small chunks of code
# that return values that the agent can then send back to the requestor.
#
# == A simple example agent
#
#    require 'snmp/agent'
#
#    agent = SNMP::Agent.new(:port => 16161, :logger => Logger.new(STDOUT))
#    agent.add_plugin('1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0') do
#      SNMP::TimeTicks.new(File.read('/proc/uptime').split(' ')[0].to_f * 100).to_i)
#    end
#    agent.start()
#
# This agent will respond to requests for the given OID (hrSystemUptime in
# this case, as it happens) and return the number of time ticks as read from
# the /proc/uptime file.  In this plugin, we've defined the exact and
# complete OID that we want to return the value of, but that's by no means
# necessary -- one plugin can handle a larger number of OIDs in itself by
# simply defining the 'base' OID it wants to handle, and returning
# structured data when it's called.  The pre-defined plugin for basic system
# parameters is a good (if basic) example of how you structure your data.
#
# == Writing plugins
#
# I've tried to make writing plugins as painless as possible, but
# unfortunately there's still a fair amount of hassle that's required in
# some circumstances. A basic understanding of how SNMP MIBs and OIDs work
# will help immensely.
#
# The basic layout of all plugins is the same -- you map a base OID to a
# chunk of code, and then any requests for OIDs in that subtree cause the
# code to be executed to determine the value (or lack thereof).  You use
# SNMP::Agent#add_plugin to add a new plugin. This method takes a base OID
# (as a string or an array of integers) and a block of code to be run when
# the requested OID matches the given base OID.
#
# The result from the block of code should either be a single value (if you
# want the base OID to return a value itself), a simple array or hash (if
# the base OID maps to a list of entries), or a tree of arrays and/or hashes
# that describes the data underneath the base OID.
#
# For example, if you want OID .1.2.3 to return the single value 42, you
# would do something like this:
#
#    agent = SNMP::Agent.new
#    agent.add_plugin('1.2.3') { 42 }
#
# Internally, when a Get request for the OID .1.2.3 is received, the agent
# will find the plugin, run it, and return a PDU containing 'INTEGER: 42'.
# Any request for an OID below .1.2.3 will be answered with NoSuchObject.
#
# If you want to return a list of dwarves, you could do this:
#
#    agent.add_plugin('1.2.4') { %w{sleepy grumpy doc crazy hungry} }
#
# In this case, requesting the OID '1.2.4' will get you NoSuchObject, but
# requesting '1.2.4.0' will get you the OCTET STRING 'sleepy', and
# requesting '1.2.4.3' will return 'crazy'.  You could also walk the whole
# of the '1.2.4' subtree and you'll get each of the dwarves in turn.
#
# "Sparse" data can be handled in much the same way, but with a hash instead
# of an array.  So a list of square roots, indexed by the squared value,
# might look like this:
#
#    agent.add_plugin('1.2.5') { {1 => 1, 4 => 2, 9 => 3, 16 => 4, 25 => 5} }
#
# Now, if you get '1.2.5.9', you'll get the INTEGER 3, but if you get either
# of '1.2.5.8' or '1.2.5.10' you'll get noSuchObject.
#
# More complicated tree structures are possible, too -- such as a
# two-dimensional "multiplication table", like so:
#
#    agent.add_plugin('1.2.6') { [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#                                 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
#                                 [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
#                                 [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15],
#                                 [0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20],
#                                 [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
#                                ]
#                              }
#
# Now you can get the product of any two numbers between 0 and 5 by simply
# doing a get on your agent for '1.2.6.n.m' -- or you could use a
# calculator.
#
# The real value of plugins isn't static data like the above examples, it's
# dynamic creation of data -- reading things from files, parsing kernel
# data, that sort of thing.  The only limitation is that it has to fit into
# the SNMP way of doing things (tables and lists and values, oh my!) and you
# need to be able to write the code for it.
#
# === Restrictions for plugin OIDs
#
# You cannot have a plugin respond to a subtree of another plugin.  That is,
# if you have one plugin which has registered itself as handling '1.2.3',
# you cannot have another plugin that says it handles '1.2' or '1.2.3.4' --
# in either case, the two plugins will conflict.
#
# This restriction isn't really an SNMP one, it's more of a sanity-saving
# measure.  Imagine the confusion from having to troubleshoot wrong values
# in a heavily nested plugin tree...
#
# If you have a deep and abiding need to nest plugins, however, get in
# contact and we'll see about removing the limitation.
#
# === Plugins and data types
#
# There is a limted amount of type interpolation in the plugin handler.
# At present, integer values will be kept as integers, and most everything
# else will be converted to an OCTET STRING.  If you have a particular need
# to return values of particular SNMP types, the agent will pass-through any
# SNMP value objects that are created, so if you just *had* to return a
# Gauge32 for a particular OID, you could do:
#
#    agent.add_plugin('1.2.3') { SNMP::Gauge32.new(42) }
#
# === Caching plugin data
#
# Often, running a plugin to collect data is quite expensive -- if you're
# calling out to a web service or doing a lot of complex calculations, and
# generating a large resulting tree, you really don't want to be re-doing
# all that work for every SNMP request (and remember, during a walk, that
# tree is going to be completely recreated for every element walked in that
# tree).
#
# To prevent this problem, the SNMP agent provides a fairly simple caching
# mechanism within itself.  If you return the data from your plugin as a
# hash, you can add an extra element to that hash, with a key of
# <tt>:cache</tt>, which should have a value of how many seconds you want
# the agent to retain your data for before re-running the plugin.  So, a
# simple cached data tree might look like:
#
#   {:cache => 30, 0 => [0, 1, 2], 1 => ['a', 'b', 'c']}
#
# So the agent will cache the given data (<tt>{0 => [...], 1 => [...]}</tt>) for
# 30 seconds before running the plugin again to get a new set of data.
#
# How long should you cache data for?  That's up to you.  The tradeoffs are
# between the amount of time it takes to create the data tree, how quickly
# the data "goes stale", and how large the data tree is.  The longer it
# takes to re-create the tree and the larger the tree is, the longer you
# should cache for.  Large trees should be cached for longer because big
# trees take longer to walk, and it'd be annoying if, half-way through the
# walk, the plugin got called again.  How long the data is relevant for is
# essentially the upper bound on cache time -- there's no point in keeping
# data around for longer than it's valid.
#
# What if, for some reason, you can't come up with a reasonable cache
# timeout value? You've got a huge tree, that takes ages to produce, but it
# needs to be refreshed really often.  Try splitting your single monolithic
# plugin into smaller "chunks", each of which can be cached separately. The
# smaller trees will take less time to walk, and hopefully you won't need to
# do the full set of processing to obtain the subset of values, so it'll be
# quicker to process.
#
# The one limitation on caching is that you can't cache a single value,
# because you need to return a hash to provide the :cache key.  This is yet
# to cause anyone any problems, however I am aware of the potential problem,
# and if it causes anyone major grief, please get in touch and we'll work out
# an alternate solution.
# 
# === Communities in Plugins
#
# If you have a need to examine the community that was passed to the SNMP
# request that caused your plugin to be run, you can provide an argument to
# your block and have the community put in there.  For instance:
#
#   agent.add_plugin('1.2.3.4') { |c| c }
#
# Will return the community name passed to any request for the OID .1.2.3.4.
#
# Note that plugin value caching and community inspection do not play well
# together at present -- if you return a value and ask for it to be cached,
# it will be cached regardless of the community that is used in subsequent
# requests.  Thus, if you have a need to examine the community in your plugin,
# don't ask the agent to cache the response.
# 
# === "Declining" a request
#
# If you're writing a plugin that, in some instances, should completely fail
# to respond, you can raise a DontReplyException.  This will cause the agent
# to not send a response PDU.  Note the difference between raising
# DontReplyException and returning nil -- the latter will cause a
# NoSuchObject response, while the former will make the server look like a
# black hole.
#
# There is a potential issue with raising DontReplyException if there are
# multiple OIDs in the request PDU, in that no response will be sent if
# *any* of the OIDs return a DontReplyException.  Hence they should be used
# with caution.
#
# === Bulk plugin loading
#
# If you've got a large collection of plugins that you want to include in
# your system, you don't have to define them all by hand within your code --
# you can use the <tt>add_plugin_dir</tt> method to load all of the plugins
# present in a directory.
#
# There are two sorts of plugin files recognised by the loader:
#
# - Any files whose names look like OIDs.  In this case, the filename is
#   used as the base OID for the plugin, and the contents of the file are
#   taken as the complete code to run for the plugin.  This method is
#   really only suitable for fairly simple plugins, and is mildly
#   deprecated -- practical experience has shown that this method of
#   defining a plugin is actually fairly confusing.
#
# - Any file in the plugin directory which ends in <tt>.rb</tt> is evaluated
#   as ruby code, in the context of the SNMP::Agent object which is running
#   <tt>add_plugin_dir</tt>.  This means that any methods or classes defined in
#   the file are in the scope of the SNMP::Agent object itself.  To
#   actually add a plugin in this instance, you need to run
#   <tt>self.add_plugin</tt> explicitly. This method of defining plugins
#   externally is preferred, since although it is more verbose, it is much
#   more flexible and lends itself to better modularity of plugins.
#
# == Proxying to other SNMP agents
#
# Although the Ruby SNMP agent is quite versatile, it currently lacks a lot
# of the standard MIB trees that we know and love.  This means, of course,
# that if you want to walk standard trees, like load averages, disk
# partitions, and network statistics, you'll need to be running another SNMP
# agent on your machines in addition to this agent.  Rather than doing the
# dirty and making you remember whatever non-standard port you may have put
# one (or both) of the agents on, you can instead proxy the other agent
# through the Ruby SNMP agent.
#
# The syntax for this is very simple:
#
#   agent.add_proxy(oid, host, port)
#
# This simple call will cause any request to any part of the MIB subtree
# rooted at <oid> to be fulfilled by making an SNMP request to the agent
# running on <host> and listening on <port> and returning whatever that
# agent sends back to us.
#
# A (minor) limitation at the moment is that you can't proxy a subtree
# provided by the backend agent to a different subtree in the Ruby SNMP
# agent.  I don't consider this to be a major limitation, as -- due to the
# globally-unique and globally-meaningful semantics of the MIB -- you
# shouldn't have too much call for changing OIDs in proxies.
#
# There are some oddities in the proxy in the area of communities, and as far
# as I am aware nobody is doing anything particularly taxing with the proxy,
# so it may harbour unpleasant corner cases.  Sorry about that.
