* Add a real-world agent binary for those who just want a simple,
  stand-alone SNMP agent to replace net-snmpd.

* Provide a multi-threaded mode for the listener.

* Support symbolic OID specification in add_plugin -- that is, allow you to
  specify a MIB name rather than a giant opaque collection of numbers.  This
  involves detecting that the OID given isn't already an ObjectId, having an
  SNMP::MIB object on hand, loading the appropriate MIB module into the MIB
  object (via SNMP::MIB#load_module), and then calling SNMP::MIB#oid with
  the symbolic name.  That's going to be a bit of a pain, especially when
  you consider the requirement to pre-register the modules -- unless we just
  unconditionally load all modules at agent startup -- it's not going to be
  that much effort, after all...
